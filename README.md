# LangGraph MultiAgent Network Demo

This is an example of how you can use LangGraph to create a network of LLMs.

## Installation

- Download Ollama - https://ollama.com/blog/llama3
- Run the LLMs you wish to using Ollama. 
  - For all the models I use:
    - Run ./modelfiles/run.bat for Windows users.
    - Run the individual modelfiles using Ollama.
- Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies using the requirements.txt file (pip install -r requirements.txt)

## Use

- Run main.py, which will give you a CLI to talk to this network.
